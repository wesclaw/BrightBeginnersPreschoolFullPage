            <p>
              

              Imagine children who believe in themselves, follow their dreams and are not afraid to try new things. Children who never give up, even if they fail to achieve something. Children who respect other people and understand their own emotions. Children who speak English fluently, have healthy habits and enjoy physical activity. These are all our children. Thanks to the safe environment, and the friendly and supportive atmosphere, all our children are able to be their true selves and to fully develop their talents.
              
              <h5 class="first">Our Mission</h5>
              
              We know that every child is unique and has talent. Our mission is to discover and develop these talents. Pre-school is a crucial stage of education during which not only do children play but also shape their notion of themselves and their surroundings. Where they learn how to adopt a creative approach to different tasks, how to discover the world, how to respect other people, and how not to be impacted by negative emotions. If children receive the right support and guidance during this stage of their lives, in the future they are able to achieve anything they want.

A small pre-school with a family atmosphere, with small groups – up to 16 children – with two teachers looking after each group.

Having a healthy lifestyle is another important issue for us, which is why we play different sports, grow vegetables and learn how to cook. Our menu is created by a pediatric nutritionist and the meals are prepared in our kitchen with the use of organic products. We bake our own bread and make freshly-squeezed juices.</p><p><span><img src="w.png" class="o-image"></span>e come from different cultures, but we have in common a love for children, and a passion and sensitivity to children’s needs. We encourage the joy of discovering the world through “learning by doing” with the use of experiments and microscopes. We motivate our children using elements of the Montessori Method. We adopt a “help me to do it myself” approach. We are far more than simply an English international pre-school. We offer a place created with a love for children, and with an aim of realising the individual potential of each child.

              Children are physically and emotionally safe at our preschool. We watch over the safety of children and respond promptly to their needs. We help them understand their own and others’ emotions.
            </p><p style="line-height: 1.9em">Safety is a priority for us, as is a sense of acceptance of who they are. We teach them the rules of coexisting in a group and appropriate conflict resolution or coping methods with failures. All our teachers have completed a first aid course. We follow the rules, precautions and high safety standards to be sure that our pupils are safe both in the hall and in the garden, as well as during excursions outside of the preschool. All toys in the rooms are safe and age appropriate.</p><p style="line-height: 1.9em">The only people entering the premises of our preschool are children attending the facility, those employed by us or those who are pre-arranged for a meeting. We have UVC lamps and all surfaces are cleaned and disinfected daily. There are also resources for hand disinfection, etc.</p>

These excursions can include visits to museums, historical sites, nature reserves, and other locations that offer educational and recreational opportunities. By regularly exposing students to diverse learning environments, school trips can contribute to their overall academic and personal development. Moreover, they offer a break from the routine of daily school life and allow students to recharge and approach their studies with renewed energy and enthusiasm.</p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.9em;"><span><img src="o.png" class="o-image"></span>ne of our most important tasks is to create conditions for the comprehensive development of children. It is important that children can take part in a variety of activities and develop their skills within different fields. We carry out this task, among others, thanks to cooperation with the best specialists. Our trainers, teachers and instructors share passion, positive energy and
            the ability to pass knowledge to children. It is of the utmost importance as talent can be discovered at any age. We have a fantastic soccer coach and dance teacher. Our kids also take part in rhythmics classes, cooking workshops that alternate with experiments as well as Spanish classes with a nativeSpanish speaker.</p>

            <p style="line-height: 1.9em;"><span><img src="eblue.png" class="o-image"></span>very 5 months you receive a development report written by all the teachers and instructors from any additional classes. The report provides information on the intellectual, physical, social, emotional, and language development of the child. We identify any areas which may need improvement and set out how the teachers are going to address this, and how you may support them. We believe the best results are achieved when teachers and parents work together.</p>
