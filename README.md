# BrightBeginnersPreschoolFullPage
My full length project website for Bright Beginners Preschool. The project took about 7 days to design and code. I used HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, and some JAVASCRIPT. A few challenges were using a backgrounnd video which took up so much space so I had to convert it to a smaller file size. Made a few updates by adding a loading bar until all the DOM is loading. There was an issue with the video not fully loading.
